This project was an exploratory venture into the realm of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and facial recognition technologies. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, the primary objective was to develop a model capable of identifying faces in images and classifying them based on sex and ethnicity.

# Objectives and Learning Outcomes
The key steps and achievements in this project included:

* Building and training a CNN model to recognize and classify facial features.
* Processing and preparing the dataset for efficient training of the neural network.
* Implementing image classification to detect sex and ethnicity in facial images.
* Integrating the model with cv2 to interface with my computer's camera, allowing the model to analyze and classify faces in real-time.

This project was a significant learning experience in applying CNNs and understanding the nuances of facial recognition systems.

# Reflections and Future Improvements
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the complexities of neural network training and real-time image processing. For future projects, I aim to:

* Further refine the accuracy and efficiency of the facial recognition model.
* Explore advanced neural network architectures to improve classification performance.
* Implement additional features such as age detection or emotion recognition.
* Enhance the real-time processing capabilities to handle dynamic environments and diverse lighting conditions.

These improvements will contribute to developing a more robust and versatile facial recognition system, advancing my skills in the field of computer vision and machine learning.
