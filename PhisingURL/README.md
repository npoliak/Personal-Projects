# Phising Link Detection

This project was an educational endeavor into the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on developing a model to differentiate between legitimate and phishing links. The goal was to apply NLP techniques to analyze and classify web links, enhancing my understanding of how language processing can be leveraged in cybersecurity.

# Objectives and Learning Outcomes
The main activities and achievements of this project included:

* Gathering and preprocessing a dataset of web URLs, categorizing them into normal and phishing links.
* Exploring various NLP techniques to process and extract features from the URLs.
* Training a machine learning model to classify the URLs based on their likelihood of being phishing attempts.
* Evaluating the model's performance and accuracy in identifying potential phishing links.

This project was instrumental in developing my skills in NLP and understanding its applications in the context of web security.

# Reflections and Future Improvements
This initial foray into NLP for security purposes revealed several areas for growth and improvement. In future projects, I plan to:

* Explore more sophisticated NLP techniques and algorithms for feature extraction from URLs.
* Increase the dataset size and diversity to improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.
* Experiment with different classification models and ensemble techniques to enhance detection accuracy.
* Integrate the model with real-time web browsing data to test its effectiveness in a dynamic online environment.

These advancements will not only improve the effectiveness of phishing detection but also expand my expertise in applying NLP in practical, real-world scenarios.
